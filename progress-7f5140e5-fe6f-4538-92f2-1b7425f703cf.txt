# Progress Log
Run: 7f5140e5-fe6f-4538-92f2-1b7425f703cf
Task: Vendor & Account Registry for Mission Control
Started: 2026-02-17 18:12 UTC

## Codebase Patterns
- Database uses `better-sqlite3` with WAL mode and foreign keys enabled
- Schema created with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pattern in db.js
- CHECK constraints used for enum validation (category, billing_cycle, status)
- Indexes created with CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS pattern for performance
- Prepared statements defined in stmts object for all database operations
- Tests use `node:test` framework, run with `npm test` from app/ directory
- DECIMAL type used for monetary values (cost_monthly, cost_annual)
- JSON stored as TEXT in users column, parsed with JSON.parse/stringify
- Timestamps use datetime('now') defaults for created_at/updated_at
- All database operations go through prepared statements for security
- **Seed data pattern**: Use INSERT OR IGNORE to handle re-runs, wrap in transactions for atomicity
- **Naming compatibility**: Both exact API names (getVendorById) and legacy aliases (getVendor) can coexist
- **Test coverage**: Each user story gets comprehensive test suite covering all acceptance criteria
- **API endpoints pattern**: `/api/{resource}` with query param filtering (e.g., `/api/vendors?status=active&department=Sales`)
- **Multi-filter logic**: Use specific prepared statements when possible, fall back to getAllX().filter() for complex combinations
- **Activity logging**: Use logActivity(action, entity_type, entity_id, message, actor) to audit API access
- **JSON response parsing**: Always JSON.parse() stored TEXT fields that should be arrays/objects before returning
- **CRUD endpoints pattern**: Individual resource endpoints follow REST conventions (GET /:id, POST /, PATCH /:id, DELETE /:id)
- **PATCH endpoint design**: Use `req.body.field !== undefined` checks to distinguish between null updates and field omissions
- **Soft delete pattern**: Use status field update rather than DELETE FROM for data retention and audit purposes
- **Table sorting pattern**: Use state object (column, direction), visual indicators (↕ ↑ ↓), and onclick handlers on headers
- **Currency formatting**: Use parseFloat().toFixed(2) for consistent $X.XX display in UI
- **Sortable table headers**: Add cursor-pointer, hover:bg-[color] transitions, and onclick="sortTableFunction(column)"
- **Table colspan consistency**: Empty/loading states must match actual column count for proper layout

## 2026-02-17 18:12 - US-001: Create vendors table schema and migration
- Created vendors table with all 15 required columns (id, name, category, url, plan, cost_monthly, cost_annual, billing_cycle, owner, users, department, status, login_email, notes, renewal_date, created_at, updated_at)
- Added CHECK constraints for category ('lead-gen','design','infrastructure','analytics','social','communication','other'), billing_cycle ('monthly','annual','one-time','free'), and status ('active','trial','pending-approval','suspended','cancelled')
- Created indexes on status, department, and category columns for performance
- Added prepared statements for all vendor operations (getAllVendors, getVendorsByStatus, insertVendor, updateVendor, etc.)
- **Learnings:** 
  - SQLite schema follows pattern of main CREATE TABLE block followed by indexes
  - Prepared statements are crucial for performance and security
  - JSON arrays stored as TEXT and parsed/stringified in application code
  - DECIMAL type works well for monetary values in better-sqlite3

Files changed:
- app/db.js (added vendors table schema and prepared statements)
- app/test-vendors-schema.js (comprehensive test coverage)
- app/package.json (added new test file to test script)

Tests: Created comprehensive test suite covering all acceptance criteria:
- AC1: vendors table exists with all 15 columns ✅
- AC2: CHECK constraints enforce valid enum values ✅  
- AC3: indexes created on status, department, category ✅
- AC4: created_at/updated_at have datetime('now') defaults ✅
- AC5: users column stores JSON array ✅
- AC6: cost_monthly/cost_annual are DECIMAL type ✅
- AC7: basic vendor operations work correctly ✅
- AC8: prepared statements work with main database ✅

All tests pass (120/120 passed)

## 2026-02-17 18:22 - US-002: Add vendor seed data and prepared statements
- Added 8 required prepared statements to db.js stmts object: getAllVendors, getVendorById, createVendor, updateVendor, deleteVendor, getVendorsByStatus, getVendorsByDept, getVendorSummary
- Added seed data for 9 vendors: Google Workspace, Apollo.io, GoLogin, Figma, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Cloudflare, Brave Search API, Groq, ElevenLabs
- Used INSERT OR IGNORE pattern to handle re-runs safely
- JSON users arrays properly formatted for multi-user vendors (e.g., Google Workspace with 7 VPs)
- Seed data includes correct categories, costs, owners, status, and department values
- Created comprehensive test suite in test-vendors-prepared-statements.js covering all acceptance criteria
- **Learnings:**
  - INSERT OR IGNORE is crucial for seed data that might be re-run multiple times
  - JSON arrays in SQLite stored as TEXT, parsed/stringified in application code
  - Seed data transactions ensure atomicity when inserting multiple records
  - Both exact naming (getVendorById) and legacy aliases (getVendor) can coexist for compatibility
