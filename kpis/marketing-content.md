## Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **Sub-agent deployment not approved** (B003)
   - Impact: Cannot begin marketing work until agents deployed
   - Owner: Sylvia (approval)
   - ETA: TBD

2. **GA4 access not yet configured**
   - Impact: Cannot track organic traffic, establish baseline
   - Owner: Max (to configure GA4 once web properties identified)
   - ETA: TBD

3. **Website / landing page infrastructure unclear**
   - Impact: Where does content live? Do we have a website? Landing page builder?
   - Owner: Max to clarify with Sylvia/Viktor
   - ETA: TBD

### Risks
1. **Content quality without subject matter expertise**
   - Risk: AI-written content may lack technical depth or accuracy
   - Mitigation: Engineering review for technical content. Use R&I intel to inform topics. Iterate based on performance data.

2. **SEO timeline (3-6 months to see results)**
   - Risk: Organic growth is slow. May not hit +15% MoM in first few months.
   - Mitigation: PPC to supplement while SEO ramps. Set realistic expectations. Track leading indicators (keyword rankings, indexed pages).

## Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Deploy Marketing agent team** (pending approval)
2. **Keyword research** (SEO Specialist: identify top 20 target keywords)
3. **Content calendar** (Content Strategist: plan first 4 pieces for Feb/Mar)
4. **GA4 setup** (Analytics Specialist: configure tracking, establish baseline)
5. **First content published** (Content Writer: 1-2 blog posts by end of Feb)
6. **PPC test campaign** (PPC Manager: Google Ads, $100 budget, target 1-2 MQLs)

## Cross-Functional Dependencies

### From R&I (Nadia)
- **Actionable intel items** (≥5/week) → Inform content topics, competitive positioning, SEO keywords
- **Competitive briefs** → Identify competitor weaknesses to target in content

### To Sales (Elena)
- **MQLs** (≥10/month) → Hand off qualified leads for SQL conversion
- **Content for Sales enablement** → Case studies, whitepapers, battle cards

### From Engineering (Viktor)
- **Technical review** → Ensure content accuracy for product/technical topics
- **Product updates** → Inform content (feature announcements, release notes)

---

## Notes

- **Content strategy:** Focus on high-intent, bottom-of-funnel content initially (product pages, comparison pages). Expand to top-of-funnel (thought leadership, industry trends) as traffic grows.
- **PPC strategy:** Start small ($100/mo), prove ROI, then scale with CEO approval.
- **SEO timeline:** Expect 3-6 months to see significant organic growth. Track leading indicators (keyword rankings, backlinks, indexed pages) in the meantime.
- **Lead gen infrastructure:** Need to define (website, landing pages, forms, CRM integration). Coordinate with Sales (Elena) on MQL handoff process.
