## Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **Sub-agent deployment not approved** (B003)
   - Impact: Cannot begin intel work until agents deployed
   - Owner: Sylvia (approval)
   - ETA: TBD

### Risks
1. **Intel sources not yet identified**
   - Risk: May not have access to competitive data sources needed for deep intel
   - Mitigation: Start with public sources (LinkedIn, press releases, company blogs, Crunchbase). Evaluate paid intel services (CB Insights, Gartner, etc.) if needed.

---

## Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Deploy R&I agent team** (pending approval)
2. **Identify intel sources** (free and paid)
3. **Deliver first competitive brief** (by 2026-02-20)
4. **Establish intel handoff to Marketing and Sales** (5+ actionable items/week)
5. **Baseline C-level signal tracking** (LinkedIn, press releases, funding announcements)

---

## Notes

- **Competitors to track:** Haivision, Zixi, Fastly, Limelight, Akamai (SRT platform). Expand to CDN competitors when CDN product begins.
- **Intel flow to Marketing:** Inform content strategy, SEO keywords, competitive positioning
- **Intel flow to Sales:** Competitive objection handling, pricing intel, customer pain points
- **Quality over quantity:** Focus on actionable, high-value intel (not noise)
