## Detailed KPI Tracking

### 1. SQL Conversion from MQLs
**Target:** ≥40% (convert marketing-qualified leads to sales-qualified leads)

**Purpose:** Measure quality of inbound leads and effectiveness of qualification process

**Process:**
1. Marketing delivers MQL (qualified based on job title, company size, engagement)
2. Lead Qualifier agent reviews MQL, assesses fit and intent
3. If qualified: SQL (assigned to Outbound SDR for outreach)
4. If not qualified: Nurture or disqualify

**SQL Criteria:**
- Budget authority or influence
- Timing (need identified within 3-6 months)
- Fit (use case matches our product)
- Intent (active evaluation, not just browsing)

**Current State:** Awaiting MQLs from Marketing (not yet operational)

**Historical Data:**
| Month | MQLs Received | SQLs Converted | Conversion Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02 | 0 | 0 | — | Awaiting MQLs |

**Next Milestone:** First MQL handoff from Marketing (target: end of Feb), establish baseline conversion rate

---

### 2. Pipeline Value
**Target:** Tracked weekly (trend should be growing)

**Purpose:** Monitor sales pipeline health, forecast revenue

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **SQL** — Qualified, assigned to SDR
2. **Discovery** — Initial call, needs assessment
3. **Proposal** — Quote/proposal sent
4. **Negotiation** — Pricing, terms, contracts
5. **Closed-Won** — Deal closed
6. **Closed-Lost** — Deal lost (track reason)

**Measurement:** Total value of all active opportunities (stages 1-4)

**Current State:** Not started (no CRM, Sales Ops building stopgap tracker)

**Historical Data:**
| Week Ending | Total Pipeline Value | New Opps | Closed-Won | Closed-Lost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-16 | $0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not started |

**Next Milestone:** Stopgap pipeline tracker operational by 2026-02-20

---

### 3. Cross-Sell Outreach (SRT → CDN)
**Target:** 100% of SRT customers contacted within 30 days of CDN launch

**Purpose:** Revenue expansion into existing customer base

**Process:**
1. Receive SRT customer list (CSV from CEO)
2. Segment customers (usage tier, contract value, engagement level)
3. Prioritize outreach (high-value customers first)
4. Outbound SDR contacts each customer (email + LinkedIn)
5. Discovery call for interested customers
6. Track conversion to CDN product

**Current State:** 🔴 Blocked — Customer CSV not yet received (B001)

**Historical Data:**
| Customer Segment | Total Customers | Contacted | Discovery Calls | SQLs | Closed-Won | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Awaiting CSV] | — | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Blocked |

**Next Milestone:** Receive customer CSV from David, begin segmentation and outreach plan

**Note:** CDN product deferred by CEO. Cross-sell campaign will begin when CDN is ready to launch.

---

### 4. Win Rate
**Target:** ≥25% (closed-won / total closed opportunities)

**Purpose:** Measure sales effectiveness, identify areas for improvement

**Measurement:** (Closed-Won) / (Closed-Won + Closed-Lost)

**Win/Loss Analysis:**
- **Why we win:** Competitive advantages, pricing, features, relationships
- **Why we lose:** Competitive losses (to whom?), pricing, timing, fit

**Current State:** Not started (no closed deals yet)

**Historical Data:**
| Month | Closed-Won | Closed-Lost | Win Rate | Top Win Reasons | Top Loss Reasons |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02 | 0 | 0 | — | — | — |

**Next Milestone:** Close first deal, establish baseline win rate, conduct first win/loss analysis

---

### 5. Deal Cycle Time
**Target:** Tracked (establish baseline, then optimize)

**Purpose:** Understand how long deals take to close, identify bottlenecks

**Measurement:** Days from SQL to Closed-Won

**Segmentation:** By deal size, customer segment, product (SRT vs. CDN)

**Current State:** Not started (no closed deals yet)

**Historical Data:**
| Month | Avg Deal Cycle (days) | By Segment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02 | — | — | Not started |

**Next Milestone:** Close first deals, establish baseline cycle time by segment

## Team Status

### Agent Deployment Status
| Agent | Role | Status | Last Activity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lead Qualifier | MQL → SQL conversion | ⏳ Not deployed | — |
| Outbound SDR | Cross-sell outreach, discovery calls | ⏳ Not deployed | — |
| Sales Ops | Pipeline tracking, forecasting | ⏳ Not deployed | — |
| Partnership BD | Strategic partnerships | ⏳ Not deployed | — |
| Customer Success | Onboarding, retention, upsell | ⏳ Not deployed | — |

**Total:** 0/5 agents deployed

## Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **Sub-agent deployment not approved** (B003)
   - Impact: Cannot begin sales work until agents deployed
   - Owner: Sylvia (approval)
   - ETA: TBD

2. **Customer CSV not received** (B001)
   - Impact: Cannot begin cross-sell outreach to SRT customer base
   - Owner: Elena to follow up with David (CEO)
   - ETA: Unknown

3. **No CRM system** (B004)
   - Impact: Pipeline visibility limited, manual tracking required
   - Workaround: Sales Ops building stopgap tracker (spreadsheet)
   - Owner: Elena (Sales Ops agent)
   - ETA: Stopgap by 2026-02-20. Long-term CRM selection TBD.

### Risks
1. **Dependency on Marketing for MQLs**
   - Risk: If Marketing doesn't deliver ≥10 MQLs/month, Sales pipeline is empty
   - Mitigation: Outbound SDR can prospect independently (LinkedIn, cold outreach). Partner with R&I for account lists. Don't rely solely on inbound.

2. **CDN product deferred → revenue timeline unclear**
   - Risk: If CDN launch is delayed, cross-sell revenue is delayed
   - Mitigation: Focus on optimizing SRT platform sales in the meantime. Build partnerships pipeline (revenue diversification).

## Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Deploy Sales agent team** (pending approval)
2. **Stopgap pipeline tracker operational** (Sales Ops: spreadsheet or lightweight tool)
3. **MQL handoff process defined** (with Marketing: criteria, handoff method, SLA)
4. **Customer CSV received** (Elena to follow up with David)
5. **Cross-sell outreach plan drafted** (segmentation, messaging, timeline)
6. **Partnership pipeline started** (Partnership BD: identify 5-10 potential partners)

---

## Cross-Functional Dependencies

### From Marketing (Max)
- **MQLs** (≥10/month) → Sales converts to SQLs, closes deals
- **Sales enablement content** → Case studies, whitepapers, battle cards for discovery calls

### From R&I (Nadia)
- **Competitive intel** → Objection handling, competitive positioning
- **Account lists** → Outbound prospecting targets (companies in target segments)

### To Customer Success (Internal)
- **Closed-Won customers** → Hand off for onboarding and retention
- **Upsell/cross-sell opportunities** → Identify expansion revenue within customer base

---

## Notes

- **Sales motion:** Primarily inbound (MQLs from Marketing) + cross-sell (SRT → CDN). Outbound prospecting secondary (if MQL volume low).
- **CRM decision:** Need to select CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, etc.). Budget approval required. Interim: stopgap tracker.
- **Partnership strategy:** Strategic partnerships with CDN providers, broadcast networks, systems integrators (future revenue channel).
- **Customer success:** Retention and upsell are critical (SaaS model). Customer Success agent owns this post-sale.

- Add pipeline data as deals progress
- Flag blockers in `blockers.md` immediately (especially if MQL flow dries up)

**For Sylvia (COO):**
- Review this file weekly (Fridays)
- Monitor MQL → SQL → Closed-Won funnel health
- Approve CRM budget when Elena presents options with ROI case
