## 💡 Operating Model v2 (Established Feb 17)

### Strategy: "No Browser" — AI-Native Workflows
- **Engineering (Viktor):** Claude Opus/Sonnet — direct code generation
- **Research (Nadia):** Gemini Ultra Deep Research via Prompt Packets (manual handoff)
- **Design (Zara):** "Figma Factory" — templates + programmatic data injection
- **Marketing (Max):** Content gen + social scheduling via MC calendar
- **Sales (Elena):** CRM + Apollo.io + programmatic outreach (pending approval)

### Key Decisions (Feb 17)
- **Logo: Stream Array** — 9 SVG variants
- **Akamai is infrastructure provider** — INTERNAL ONLY, never mention as competitor
- **CDN Launch: March 18, 2026** — GTM plan approved
- **Pricing proposed:** Starter $79/mo, Pro $299/mo, Enterprise $2,500/mo (14-day trial)
- **CTA: "Start free trial"** for all landing pages
- **Comparison pages:** Cloudflare, Fastly, CloudFront only (no Akamai)
- **Elena: prepare but DO NOT send** outbound without David's explicit "go"
- **Rolling 7-day content calendar** policy for Max
- **Multi-model fleet locked:** Claude (eng), Gemini (research/design), OpenAI (ops/sales)
- **Security framework deployed:** 3-tier authorization (Tier 1 free / Tier 2 session code / Tier 3 single-use)

### Pending David Decisions
1. Elena outreach infrastructure (Apollo + GoLogin + domain) — Action #137
2. CDN pricing approval ($79/$299/$2,500) — Action #147
3. Edgio rescue campaign — yes/no?
4. GitHub repo access — Action #146
5. SEMrush/Ahrefs budget for Max — Action #107
