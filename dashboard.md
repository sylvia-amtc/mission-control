## 💡 Operating Model v2 (Established Feb 17)

### Strategy: "No Browser" — AI-Native Workflows

- **Research (Nadia):** Gemini Ultra Deep Research via Prompt Packets (manual handoff)
- **Design (Zara):** "Figma Factory" — templates + programmatic data injection
- **Marketing (Max):** Content gen + social scheduling via MC calendar
- **Sales (Elena):** CRM + Apollo.io + programmatic outreach (pending approval)

### Key Decisions (Feb 17-19)

- **Elena: prepare but DO NOT send** outbound without David's explicit "go"
- **Rolling 7-day content calendar** policy for Max
- **Multi-model fleet locked:** Claude (eng), Gemini (research/design), OpenAI (ops/sales)
- **Security framework deployed:** 3-tier authorization (Tier 1 free / Tier 2 session code / Tier 3 single-use)
- **Viktor: no direct coding** — plan/architect/review only; big tasks via AntFarm, small via Sonnet sub-agents (Feb 18)
- **All agent ↔ MC communication via MCP only** — no direct API calls (Feb 18)
- **No weekend social posts** — Max standing order (Feb 18)
- **GCP mail relay live** — elena@amtc.dev on Instantly.ai, warmup started (Feb 18)
- **R&I → Marketing content pipeline** — Nadia's daily briefings feeding Max's calendar (Feb 19)
- **No existing customers confirmed** — Starting from scratch, cross-sell playbook deprioritized (Feb 18)

### Pending David Decisions
