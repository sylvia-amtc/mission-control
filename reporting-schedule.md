## Reporting Standards

### For Department VPs
1. **Update your KPI file:** `kpis/<department>.md` by Thursday EOD
2. **Include context:** Don't just update numbers. Add brief notes on trends, wins, issues.
3. **Flag blockers:** If something is blocking progress, add to `blockers.md` immediately (don't wait for Thursday).
4. **Be honest:** Report reality, not aspirations. Sylvia needs accurate data to make decisions.

### For Sylvia (COO)
1. **Review all KPIs:** Every Friday, review all department updates
2. **Synthesize, don't copy-paste:** Weekly ops report should highlight key insights, not rehash raw data
3. **Prioritize for CEO:** Executive summary should be concise, high-level, action-oriented
4. **Track trends:** Look for patterns across departments (e.g., multiple teams blocked on same issue)

### For David (CEO)
1. **Read exec summary:** Monday mornings, read Sylvia's executive summary
2. **Provide decisions:** If blockers need CEO input, respond quickly
3. **Access to detail:** Full dashboard and department KPIs available if CEO wants deeper dive

## Reporting Quality Metrics

### For Department Reports
- **Timeliness:** 100% on-time (Thursdays EOD)
- **Completeness:** All KPIs updated, no blanks
- **Clarity:** Trends and context explained, not just raw numbers
- **Actionability:** Blockers flagged with clear next steps

### For COO Reports
- **Timeliness:** Weekly ops report (Fridays), CEO exec summary (Mondays)
- **Relevance:** Focus on what matters (strategic priorities, blockers, key metrics)
- **Brevity:** CEO exec summary <1 page, weekly ops report <3 pages
- **Accuracy:** All data verified against source KPIs

---

## Escalation for Late Reports

1. **If VP misses deadline (Thursday EOD):**
   - Sylvia follows up immediately (Friday morning)
   - If critical blocker preventing report, escalate to resolve blocker
   - If pattern emerges, Sylvia addresses with VP

2. **If Sylvia misses deadline (Friday/Monday):**
   - Self-escalate to David if needed
   - Adjust schedule if reporting load is unsustainable

---

## Reporting Tools

### Current (Manual)
- **KPI tracking:** Markdown files in `kpis/`
- **Report generation:** Markdown files in `reports/` (from templates)
- **Distribution:** Git commits, message to recipients

### Future Enhancements (TBD)
- **Automated KPI aggregation:** Pull data from source systems (GA4, CRM, monitoring)
- **Dashboard web view:** Render markdown as HTML, auto-refresh
- **Notifications:** Slack/Telegram alerts for late reports, new blockers
- **Trend visualization:** Charts and graphs from KPI data

For now: keep it simple, manual, markdown-based.
